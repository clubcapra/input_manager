# READONLY EXAMPLE! Do NOT modify this file for use or use it at runtime.
# Here is an example of a list containing the setup of a single device
# The program will automatically publish only the axises set in the config
# And will publish all 0s for unspecified ones
# Therefore, if an device does not possess an input, simply delete the line from the axis

devices:
  - name: "XBOX Controller" # Display name of the input device
    id: "xxxx:xxxx" # USB Vendor ID and Product ID
    alias: "main_xbox" # Alias used in topic names (/joy_inputs/alias & /input_watchdog/alias)
    enabled: true # Wether the device is currently being listened and published
    sanitize: false # Wether the axises are sanitized clientside using the deadzone
    deadzone: 0 # Deadzone of the axises
    mapping: # Evdev mappings (array position in joy_msg: evdev ID)
